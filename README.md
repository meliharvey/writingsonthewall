This is an experimental project exploring how 3d environments with immersive qualities can be used to heal from trauma. It is particularly focused on gendered bathroom spaces and the experiences of trans and gender non-conforming people in these spaces. The goal is to have a 3d bathroom where trans people can write, scribble, or sketch on the walls. These can be stories of harassment, words of encouragement, or illustrations of emotion.
